# DTM-157: Stage 13 kickoff and execution baseline

## Context
- Stage 12 is fully closed (`Done 57 / Remaining 0`).
- Stage 13 requires a new execution contour with explicit queue, criteria, and WIP discipline.

## Goal
- Launch Stage 13 with:
  - explicit execution plan,
  - Jira-linked task queue,
  - synchronized sprint/backlog/context artifacts.

## Non-goals
- No feature delivery in kickoff slice.
- No cross-stage architectural rewrite.

## Plan
1. Verify Stage 12 closeout artifacts and trust level.
2. Publish Stage 13 execution plan with bounded slices.
3. Sync sprint/backlog/context to Stage 13 active state.
4. Record Jira evidence and close kickoff task.
