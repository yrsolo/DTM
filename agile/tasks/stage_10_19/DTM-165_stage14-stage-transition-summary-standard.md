# DTM-165: Stage 14 stage-transition summary standard

## Context
- Stage boundary messages were too generic and not decision-oriented for owner.

## Goal
- Make stage-close communication explicit, simple, and decision-ready.

## Non-goals
- Reformat all historical stage reports.

## Plan
1. Define mandatory stage transition summary fields.
2. Add requirement into control/process docs.
3. Enforce explicit owner `go/no-go` request.

## Checklist (DoD)
- [x] Stage transition standard documented in `AGENTS.md`.
- [x] Runtime contract updated.
- [x] TeamLead prompt/protocol updated.

## Work log
- 2026-02-28: Added mandatory stage-transition summary block across primary process docs.
