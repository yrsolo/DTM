# DTM-67: TSK-070 Stage 7 UI migration spike scope and acceptance checklist

## Context
- Stage 7 now provides read-model, schema snapshot, and fixture bundle artifacts.
- Stage 8 needs a controlled entry point with explicit scope for first web prototype.

## Goal
- Define minimal Spike-1 scope and objective acceptance checklist for UI migration.

## Non-goals
- No UI implementation in this task.
- No production deployment plan.

## Plan
1. Align with Stage 7 artifacts and storage policy docs.
2. Document Spike-1 in/out scope.
3. Define acceptance checklist tied to artifacts and schema compatibility.
4. Sync sprint/backlog/context docs.

## Checklist (DoD)
- [x] Spike scope document added.
- [x] Acceptance checklist includes schema validation and filter behavior.
- [x] Sprint and Stage 7 plan counters updated.
- [x] Context registry freshness evidence recorded.
