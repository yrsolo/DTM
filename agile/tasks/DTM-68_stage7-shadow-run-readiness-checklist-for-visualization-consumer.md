# DTM-68: TSK-071 Stage 7 shadow-run readiness checklist for visualization consumer

## Context
- Stage 7 artifacts and UI spike scope are already documented.
- Stage 8 requires a safe shadow-run gate before implementation expands.

## Goal
- Define explicit shadow-run readiness checklist for visualization consumer.

## Non-goals
- No code integration with frontend runtime.
- No deployment procedure in this task.

## Plan
1. Align checklist with Stage 7 artifact set and storage modes.
2. Define entry/exit rules for shadow-run.
3. Sync sprint/context/backlog references.

## Checklist (DoD)
- [x] Checklist doc added with local/cloud validation points.
- [x] Entry/exit rules documented.
- [x] Stage 7 counters updated (`done 6 / remaining 1`).
- [x] Context registry updated.
