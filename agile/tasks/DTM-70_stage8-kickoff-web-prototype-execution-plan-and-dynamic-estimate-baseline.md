# DTM-70: TSK-073 Stage 8 kickoff web prototype execution plan and dynamic estimate baseline

## Context
- Stage 7 is fully completed and closed (`done 7 / remaining 0`).
- Stage 8 requires a new execution queue focused on read-only web prototype implementation.

## Goal
- Initialize Stage 8 plan, estimate baseline, and sprint queue for execution tasks.

## Non-goals
- No Stage 8 runtime code changes in kickoff task.

## Plan
1. Create Stage 8 execution plan document.
2. Switch sprint board to Stage 8 estimate/counters.
3. Define next implementation slices (TSK-074..078).
4. Sync backlog/context references.

## Checklist (DoD)
- [x] Stage 8 plan doc added.
- [x] Sprint switched to Stage 8 (`done 1 / remaining 5`).
- [x] Next 3-5 tasks updated for Stage 8 queue.
- [x] Context/backlog references aligned.
