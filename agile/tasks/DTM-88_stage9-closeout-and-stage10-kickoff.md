# DTM-88: Stage 9 closeout and Stage 10 kickoff baseline

## Context
- Stage 9 execution queue is complete (`DTM-76..DTM-87`), but closeout/handoff package was not explicitly published.
- Stage 10 needs a clear baseline estimate and initial slice queue for controlled execution.

## Goal
- Publish Stage 9 closeout package and Stage 10 execution kickoff plan.
- Align sprint board, backlog, and documentation map with new stage boundary.

## Non-goals
- No production code changes.
- No Stage 10 execution slice implementation in this task.

## Plan
1. Publish Stage 9 closeout + Stage 10 handoff doc.
2. Publish Stage 10 execution plan with baseline estimate and initial slices.
3. Update sprint board and backlog to Stage 10 counters.
4. Update docs map/context registry and close Jira lifecycle.
