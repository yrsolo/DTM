# DTM-96: Stage 11 quantify repeated incident and rework cost

## Context
- Root-cause clusters are documented; prioritization requires approximate repeated-cost signal.

## Goal
- Produce heuristic cost estimate by incident pattern to drive corrective backlog priority.

## Non-goals
- No financial accounting precision.
- No final corrective backlog decisions in this task.

## Plan
1. Define lightweight estimation method.
2. Estimate cost by recurrent incident pattern.
3. Map findings to next-slice prioritization input.
4. Close Jira lifecycle with evidence.

## Checklist (DoD)

- [x] Cost estimate document published.
- [x] Jira evidence comment added.
