# Agile Tasks Index

`agile/tasks` is split by stage ranges to keep navigation fast.

## Folders
- `stage_00_09/` - execution tasks for stages 0-9.
- `stage_10_19/` - execution tasks for stages 10-19.
- `stage_20_plus/` - execution tasks for stages 20 and above.
- `foundation_misc/` - non-stage and foundation tasks.
- `active/` - optional short-lived mirror for currently active tasks.

## Rules
1. Create new stage tasks directly in matching stage folder.
2. Keep filenames in existing format: `DTM-<id>_<slug>.md`.
3. Do not move/delete historical task files without explicit owner approval.
4. If a task is cross-stage and not tied to one stage, place it in `foundation_misc/`.
