# DTM-94: Stage 11 timeline reconstruction across stages 0-10

## Context
- Stage 11 retrospective must be evidence-based.
- We need one consolidated timeline before clustering root causes.

## Goal
- Publish timeline document with key delivery events, incidents, and corrective actions.

## Non-goals
- No root-cause scoring in this task.
- No corrective backlog prioritization in this task.

## Plan
1. Consolidate key milestones from backlog/sprint/stage closeout docs.
2. Record major regressions and recovery points.
3. Add source pointers for traceability.
4. Close Jira lifecycle with evidence.
