# DTM-192: Stage 20 kickoff and bounded execution queue

## Context
- Stage 19 is complete and repository needs production-readiness hardening before next feature stage.
- Owner requested full pass on documentation quality, freshness, and stale-tail cleanup.

## Goal
- Start Stage 20 with explicit bounded queue and WIP=1 execution discipline.

## Non-goals
- No feature implementation.
- No production behavior changes.

## Plan
1. Publish Stage 20 execution plan.
2. Create Stage 20 task queue (`DTM-193..DTM-196`).
3. Switch sprint board to active Stage 20 state.

## Checklist (DoD)
- [x] Stage 20 plan document published.
- [x] Stage 20 queue visible in sprint board.
- [x] Active task switched to Stage 20 kickoff.

## Work log
- 2026-02-28: Initialized Stage 20 with 5-task bounded queue and activated `DTM-192`.
