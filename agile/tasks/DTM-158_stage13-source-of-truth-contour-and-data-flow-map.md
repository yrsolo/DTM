# DTM-158: Stage 13 source-of-truth contour and data flow map

## Context
- Stage 13 kickoff requires explicit ownership boundaries for execution state, runtime config, and artifact publication.

## Goal
- Publish source-of-truth and data flow map that fixes primary/secondary ownership for Stage 13 operations.

## Non-goals
- No code refactor.
- No feature implementation.

## Plan
1. Capture primary sources for sprint/backlog/context/runtime/deploy contour.
2. Document operational data flow and guardrails.
3. Sync Jira evidence and move to done.
