# Agile Strategy

## Objective
Iteratively refactor DTM without breaking production behavior.

## Current Initiatives
1. Stabilize runtime and data parsing.
2. Keep documentation and process rules always up to date.
3. Prepare architecture for future standalone frontend.

## Constraints
- Preserve working business flow.
- No secret leaks in repository.
- Changes should be small and reversible.

## Metrics
- Timer pipeline success rate.
- Time to deliver one refactoring task from idea to merge.
