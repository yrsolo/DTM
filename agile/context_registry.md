# Context Registry

Purpose: track freshness and trust of planning sources before TeamLead creates/assigns execution tasks.

## Trust Scale
- `high`: verified against runnable flow/code recently, can be used for execution tasking.
- `medium`: partially verified, safe for planning with explicit assumptions.
- `low`: not verified or conflicting; execution tasking is blocked until verification task is done.

## Usage Rules
1. Update this file before sprint grooming and before assigning new execution tasks.
2. If required source has `low` trust, create verification task first.
3. Keep evidence short and concrete (command/run/test/doc diff), without secrets.
4. Evidence used in this iteration:
   - `Get-Content local_run.py` and `Get-Content main.py` confirm active run modes include `sync-only` and `reminders-only`, with `dry_run` threading.
   - `.venv\Scripts\python.exe local_run.py --mode sync-only --dry-run` passed; no Google Sheets write requests executed.
   - `.venv\Scripts\python.exe agent\capture_baseline.py --label tsk007_smoke` produced artifact bundle with exit code 0.
   - `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pre_commit run detect-secrets --all-files` passed (`Detect secrets...Passed`).
   - `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m py_compile core\repository.py` passed after required-column validation changes.
   - `git log --oneline -n 5 -- core/repository.py` + `git blame -L 25,140 core/repository.py` confirm parser/task constructor are active drift points for Stage 1.
   - `.venv\Scripts\python.exe local_run.py --help`, `.venv\Scripts\python.exe local_run.py --mode sync-only --dry-run`, and `.venv\Scripts\python.exe local_run.py --mode timer --dry-run` passed after DTM-9 parser/normalization changes.
   - `git log --oneline -n 6 -- core/people.py core/reminder.py` + `git blame -L 1,220 core/people.py` confirm `core/people.py` stayed legacy and needed Stage 1 guardrails.
   - `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m py_compile core\people.py` and targeted people smoke script passed (`people_smoke_ok`).
   - `.venv\Scripts\python.exe local_run.py --mode reminders-only --dry-run` now passes after reminder runtime compatibility fix (`httpx` proxy setup + unicode-safe logging).
   - `git log --oneline -n 8 -- core/repository.py core/people.py core/reminder.py` confirms Stage 1 drift points and latest stabilization commits (`DTM-9..DTM-11`) before planning DTM-12 typed contract scaffold.
   - `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m py_compile core\contracts.py core\repository.py core\people.py` passed after DTM-12 typed row-contract integration.
   - `.venv\Scripts\python.exe local_run.py --mode timer --dry-run` and `.venv\Scripts\python.exe local_run.py --mode reminders-only --dry-run` passed after DTM-12 mapping changes.
   - DTM-13 migrated required-header validation to contract metadata (`TaskRowContract.required_columns`, `PersonRowContract.required_columns`) and added fail-fast people sheet validation.
   - shell-level `Env:JIRA_*` check may be empty if `.env` is not exported globally; Jira checks should load `.env` explicitly for API validation.
   - DTM-14 pre-task freshness check completed on current Stage 1 drift points (`core/repository.py`, `core/people.py`, `core/contracts.py`) via git history + blame before decomposition.
   - DTM-16 pre-task freshness check completed on row-level mapping hotspots in `core/repository.py` and `core/people.py` before execution.
   - DTM-16 row-policy smoke script passed (`row_policy_smoke_ok`) with expected skip diagnostics for malformed and duplicate IDs.
   - DTM-17 pre-task freshness check completed on `TimingParser` + `_df_to_task` paths before diagnostics/accounting changes.
   - DTM-17 timing diagnostics smoke passed (`timing_diagnostics_smoke_ok`) and timer/reminder dry-runs stayed green after parser accounting changes.
   - DTM-18 pre-task freshness check completed on local-run and baseline artifact flow before adding quality report output.
   - DTM-18 smoke passed: local run writes `--quality-report-file` JSON and baseline bundle now includes `quality_report.json`.
   - DTM-15 pre-task freshness check completed for reminder external call path and planner wiring before adding test-mode mock controls.
   - DTM-15 smoke passed for mock external reminder flow (`--mock-external`): no real Telegram sends, OpenAI enhancer bypassed by mock agent.
   - DTM-19 pre-task freshness check completed for Stage 2 decomposition sources (planner/main/repository/service coupling and recent drift).
   - DTM-20 pre-task freshness check completed for planner/main dependency-construction boundary (`S2-SLICE-01`).
   - DTM-20 smoke passed after bootstrap extraction scaffold: sync-only dry-run and reminders-only mock dry-run both green.
   - DTM-21 pre-task freshness check completed for main entrypoint orchestration branches before extracting application use-cases.
   - DTM-21 smoke passed after use-case extraction: sync/reminder branches and quality summary output preserved.
