# Sprint Retro

## What Went Well
- Clear branch and merge discipline.
- Faster iterations due to explicit status reporting.

## What Was Hard
- Legacy behavior comparison takes manual effort.
- Process rules were spread across multiple files.

## Improvements
- Keep one active sprint board in `agile/sprint_current.md`.
- Trigger owner notifications immediately on blockers requiring decision.
