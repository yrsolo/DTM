# Sprint Retro

## Latest Retro (Stage 20)

### What Went Well
- Production-readiness hardening finished without feature churn.
- Release gate is explicit: local smoke + cloud manual checks.
- Documentation became shorter and easier to navigate.

### What Was Hard
- Historical process evidence was spread across many long files.
- Overloaded `agile/tasks` root reduced discoverability.

### Improvements Applied
- `agile/tasks` is now structured by stage ranges and foundation tasks.
- Active agile docs were compacted; historical snapshots archived.
- Stage closeout notifications now clearly separate `info` vs `blocked` semantics.

## Next Retro Focus (Stage 21)
- Measure whether provider SLI thresholds reduce noisy alerts.
- Verify that runbook steps are actionable during real incidents.
- Keep sprint board concise (latest focus only, no long historical dumps).

## Ceremony Checklist Template
- Confirm sprint goal and WIP=1 adherence.
- Verify evidence links for all done tasks.
- Confirm blocker notifications were sent immediately when needed.
- Decide go/no-go for next stage with task-count estimate.
