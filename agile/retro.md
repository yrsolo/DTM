# Sprint Retro

## What Went Well
- Clear branch and merge discipline.
- Faster iterations due to explicit status reporting.

## What Was Hard
- Legacy behavior comparison takes manual effort.
- Process rules were spread across multiple files.

## Improvements
- Keep one active sprint board in `agile/sprint_current.md`.
- Trigger owner notifications immediately on blockers requiring decision.

## Ceremony Checklist Template
- Review completed sprint goals and blockers.
- Confirm follow-up Jira items for unresolved risks.
- Monthly (first retro of month): run alert-threshold drift review using recent baseline bundles and `alert_evaluation.json`, then record decision (`no tuning` / `tuning proposed`) in sprint notes.
