# Stage 11 Closeout And Stage 12 Handoff

## Stage 11 Outcome
Stage 11 retrospective is complete and converted into actionable backlog.

## Delivered Retrospective Artifacts
- Timeline reconstruction:
  - `doc/stages/25_stage11_timeline_reconstruction.md`
- Root-cause clusters:
  - `doc/stages/26_stage11_root_cause_clusters.md`
- Incident/rework cost estimate:
  - `doc/stages/27_stage11_incident_rework_cost_estimate.md`
- Corrective action backlog:
  - `doc/stages/28_stage11_corrective_action_backlog.md`
- Review package:
  - `doc/stages/29_stage11_retrospective_review_package.md`

## Readiness Gate
- [x] Stage 11 estimate reached `done 7 / remaining 0`.
- [x] Jira lifecycle completed for retrospective slices (`DTM-93..DTM-99`).
- [x] Corrective actions are prioritized with owner/date/verification signals.

## Stage 12 Start Order
1. Execute Priority A corrective actions (runtime contour hardening).
2. Execute Priority B actions (earlier failure detection).
3. Execute Priority C and D actions (process friction and onboarding continuity).
4. Publish Stage 12 evidence package and compare against Stage 11 baseline risks.
