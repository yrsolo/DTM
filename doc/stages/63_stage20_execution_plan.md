# Stage 20 Execution Plan

## Objective
Prepare the current codebase for confident production delivery by hardening documentation freshness, repository hygiene, and release evidence quality.

## Baseline
- Stage 20 estimate baseline: 5 tasks.
- Dynamic tracking rule: after each completed task, update `Done` and `Remaining` in `agile/sprint_current.md`.
- Current counter after kickoff: done `0`, remaining `5`.

## Stage 20 slices (initial)
1. `DTM-192`: kickoff and bounded queue.
2. `DTM-193`: doc/agile freshness and consistency audit.
3. `DTM-194`: documentation structure hygiene and stale-tail register.
4. `DTM-195`: pre-prod smoke run and release-readiness package.
5. `DTM-196`: closeout and Stage 21 handoff package.

## Delivery rules
- WIP stays 1 active execution task.
- Jira is optional; local tracking in `agile/sprint_current.md` + `agile/tasks/*.md` is valid control plane.
- Each completed task must include evidence in task work log and in stage docs.

## Exit criteria
- Active docs are consistent with current runtime behavior and process rules.
- Documentation map clearly separates active and historical materials.
- Release-readiness package exists with smoke evidence and explicit manual checks.
- Stage 20 closeout and Stage 21 proposal are published.
