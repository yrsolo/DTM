# Stage 13 Closeout and Stage 14 Handoff

Date: 2026-02-28
Owner: TeamLead
Closeout key: `DTM-161`

## Scope Closed
- Stage 13 execution baseline and operating contour hardening completed.
- Closed keys: `DTM-157..DTM-161`.

## Delivery Result
- Final Stage 13 counter: `Done 5`, `Remaining 0`.
- WIP=1 preserved across all slices.
- Jira lifecycle and evidence comments applied for each task.
- Telegram completion notifications sent on each closure.

## Produced Artifacts
- Stage 13 plan: `doc/stages/34_stage13_execution_plan.md`
- Source-of-truth/data-flow map: `doc/stages/35_stage13_source_of_truth_and_data_flow_map.md`
- Runtime profile matrix: `doc/stages/36_stage13_runtime_profile_matrix.md`
- Smoke/runbook normalization: `doc/stages/37_stage13_smoke_suite_and_runbook_refresh.md`

## Residual Risks
- Workspace still contains untracked `web_prototype/__pycache__/` (non-delivery artifact).
- Stage 14 product outcome is not yet selected by owner; kickoff must set explicit target first.

## Stage 14 Handoff
1. Confirm Stage 14 objective and success metric.
2. Create Stage 14 Jira queue with bounded slices and WIP=1.
3. Start first execution key and maintain synchronized sprint/backlog/context artifacts.
