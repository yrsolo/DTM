# Stage 14 Closeout and Stage 15 Handoff

Date: 2026-02-28
Owner: TeamLead
Closeout key: `DTM-166`

## Scope Closed
- Stage 14 process-clarity rollout completed.
- Closed keys: `DTM-162..DTM-166`.

## Delivery Result
- Final Stage 14 counter: `Done 5`, `Remaining 0`.
- WIP=1 preserved across all slices.
- Tracking model converged to Jira-optional with local-first compatibility.
- Owner communication semantics split into explicit `blocked` and `info` channels.

## Produced Artifacts
- Stage 14 plan: `doc/stages/39_stage14_execution_plan.md`
- Tracking policy convergence: `doc/stages/40_stage14_tracking_policy_convergence.md`
- Notification + transition standard: `doc/stages/41_stage14_owner_notification_and_transition_standard.md`

## Residual Risks
- Historical documents still contain legacy Jira-only references in archival sections.
- Untracked `web_prototype/__pycache__/` remains as non-delivery local artifact.

## Stage 15 Handoff
1. Select Stage 15 product/engineering objective and measurable success metric.
2. Build bounded Stage 15 execution queue with WIP=1.
3. Execute first Stage 15 slice under updated communication/tracking standard.
